# Spyware

## Introduction
This program was built in Python and consists on a blend of a keylogger and screenlogger. For a specified amount of time, the script saves every user keystrokes to a text file and takes up to 5 screenshots, each one taken by a mouse click. When the time is exceded, the program creates a zip file with the generated content and sends it as an email attachment from a specified sender to a specified receiver.<br><br>

## How to run

To try out the spyware just download the .py file, go to the respective file directory and use the following command on the terminal (make sure you have Python 3 installed):

on Windows 10/11:<br>

You may also want to change the sender's and receiver's email address in the source code.
